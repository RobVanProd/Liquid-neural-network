pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Basic Usage
```python
from super_liquid_network import SuperLiquidNetwork
from super_test import generate_complex_datasets

# Create model
model = SuperLiquidNetwork(
    input_size=10,
    hidden_size=64,
    output_size=1
)

# Generate and prepare data
datasets = generate_complex_datasets()

# Train model
model.train(datasets['chaotic'])
```
